                "Biography": "Faye is a villager living in Ridgeside Village. She is currently a waitress at Pika's Restaurant, but aspires to become a self-made successful fashion designer. She is an unlockable marriage candidate, meaning that she is not initially romanceable, but becomes so after her 8 heart event, if certain conditions have been met prior.\n\nFaye is very friendly and can freely converse with many of the residents of Ridgeside. She has a clothing shop at her house where she sells clothes of her own design.\n\nIn her heart events it's revealed that she gets distracted easily whenever she gets an inspiration for a new fashion design, sometimes even forgetting to eat.",
