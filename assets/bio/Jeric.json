        "Biography": "Jericho 'Jeric' Kayden is the owner and operator of Blooming Hill Farm in Ridgeside Village, where he runs a shop selling farm supplies and produce. Born and raised on the streets of Zuzu City, Jeric was found as a young boy by the Governor, who adopted him and gave him a chance at a better life. After becoming an adult, Jeric was given a patch of land in Ridgeside Village to become self-sufficient, an opportunity for which he remains deeply grateful.\n\nJeric is known for his confident, charismatic personality and his taste for fashion. He takes pride in creating high-quality garments and always aims to look his best. Self-described as having a playboy charm, Jeric is openly flirtatious and enjoys the company of attractive people, though beneath his smooth exterior lies genuine warmth and loyalty to those he cares about.\n\nWhile Jeric runs a successful farm business, he approaches it with a competitive spirit. He's constantly comparing his farm's success to others in the valley, viewing farming as a friendly competition where he strives to prove himself the best. Despite his playful rivalry, there's no malice in his competitiveness—it's simply how he motivates himself to work harder and achieve more.\n\nJeric grew up alongside Bryle, the Governor's bodyguard, who he views almost as an older brother. Bryle regularly visits Jeric's farm, and their bond remains strong despite Jeric's independence. The Governor's support and guidance shaped much of who Jeric became, and he works hard to make his adoptive father proud.\n\nJeric shares his farm with his beloved horse Turbo, who he occasionally lets children ride at festivals. He's generally friendly with the village residents and enjoys participating in community events, always making sure to dress impressively for the occasions. His shop at Blooming Hill Farm is a popular stop for those needing quality farm supplies, and while Jeric takes his business seriously, he never loses his easygoing, charming demeanor.",

          "Spring12": "Lewis came by the other day and bought some chicken eggs. I forgot that tomorrow is the Egg Festival. Well, I'm glad I can help in the festivities.",
          "Spring23": "Hmm....I wonder if I have a good outfit for tomorrow? Oh, hey there, [Player]! Are you dressing up for the Flower Dance? I bet someone as good looking as you doesn't need to think too much about it, huh?",
          "Summer10": "I have to pick which of my crops to bring tomorrow for the soup. I want it to taste amazing... Gotta do good for the governor after the help he's given me.",
          "Summer27": "How cool would it be if you could capture the jellyfish and put them in tanks to use as lamps? That'd be pretty brutal though. Best to just enjoy the show.",
          "Fall15": "One of these years, Lewis will figure out how to fit more displays in so I can actually compete.",

          "MoonlightJellies": "Hey [Player], want to watch the jellyfish with me? Hey, can you blame a guy for wanting to be surrounded by gorgeous things on all sides?",
          "StardewValleyFair": "I think I'll close up after this kid. Keahi is scaring me! Who knows what he'll do if I don't let him ride Turbo! Anyway, what did you choose for your display, [Player]? Oh, really? Nice call!",
          "SpiritsEve": "What do you think? Pretty slick, huh? Gonna make all the honeys come runnin'.",
