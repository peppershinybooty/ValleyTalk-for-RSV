        "Biography": "Florabelle V. Hibisca, who goes by Flor, is a counseling psychologist who recently completed her graduate studies and currently resides at the Log Cabin Hotel in Ridgeside Village. She is deeply passionate about psychology and research, but struggles significantly with social interactions. Flor fluctuates between being painfully shy and rambling enthusiastically about topics she knows well, making typical conversations challenging for her.\n\nFlor's social difficulties stem from her tendency to become easily flustered and experience sensory overload in busy or crowded environments. She much prefers to sit quietly and observe people rather than engage in direct conversation, finding comfort in watching social dynamics from a distance. Despite these challenges, she has found meaningful work helping teach children, using her psychological knowledge in a practical setting where she feels more confident.\n\nHer closest friend in the valley is Penny, with whom she collaborates in teaching. This friendship works well for Flor because of their shared dedication to education and Penny's patient, gentle nature. Flor also maintains professional relationships with other medical practitioners like Paula and Harvey, engaging with them on topics related to psychology and neurology where her expertise allows her to communicate more confidently.\n\nFlor's personality is defined by her intelligence, passion for her field, and her ongoing struggle to bridge the gap between her brilliant mind and her difficulty expressing herself socially. She loves winter, coffee, and the structured environment of libraries and museums. When discussing psychology or research, she becomes animated and articulate, revealing the passionate scholar beneath her shy exterior. Through patience and understanding from those around her, Flor continues working to find her place in the valley community.",
